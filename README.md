Double-pendulum-simulation-with-Runge-Kutta-4


Theory of chaos is a sector of mathematics and physics. In order to learn more
about this topic, we studied the motion of the double pendulum. A simple
pendulum consists of a string that holds a point mass on its extremity. The
double pendulum is the chained association of two simple pendulums.
The study of the chaotic pendulum is a great example of a coupled oscillator
and even if the system seems to be quite simple its evolution is described as
chaotic. A chaotic system is a dynamic system very sensitive to the initial
conditions. Indeed, an infinitesimal change in the initial conditions produces a
totally different evolution which leads to impossible prediction of the movement
in the long term. Before studying the double pendulum, we will look at the
simple pendulum so that we could explain and reuse different concepts for the
double pendulum.
