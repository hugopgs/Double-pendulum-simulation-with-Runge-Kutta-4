Double-pendulum-simulation-with-Runge-Kutta-4


Chaos theory is a branch of mathematics and physics focused on studying complex, unpredictable systems. To explore this concept further, we examined the motion of a double pendulum. A simple pendulum consists of a point mass suspended by a string, while a double pendulum involves two simple pendulums connected in series. Despite its apparent simplicity, the double pendulum exhibits chaotic behavior, making it an excellent example of a coupled oscillator. In chaotic systems, even the slightest variation in initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes, making long-term prediction impossible. Before delving into the double pendulum, we will first review the simple pendulum to introduce key concepts that will be applied later.
